# DEAR NEXT ASSESSOR:

CONTEXT:
* I am going to work on this project beyond the scope of this assessment, which is why my site has the current set up it has. 
* It is supposed to be a clone/adaptation of an existing site. I will send you log in details separately. One login is for Testator (person writing will), and the other for Deputy (person who has been assigned by Testator to view their entry).
* I have some questions (in section below) to ask during the assessment, as I would like to source for opinions before I begin my next features.
* I finished my assessment requirements on Saturday evening, but began to work a little on other features after. Please use this commit for the assessment as it is the version that is also deployed on Heroku: https://github.com/yujunk/memento-mori/tree/fc68c8da857205a701700f3c174b307118a09701
* Heroku link: https://mementomori.herokuapp.com/

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
* CONTACTS & ADVISORY are the main pages for evaluation.
* DIFFERENT USER VIEWS are available - only visible changes is that Sidebar will have less links for Deputy role.
* I only made one Model Rspec instead of the two Models required. I attempted to make two Integration Rspecs to make up for it but got stuck on the 2nd one. This will be a question below. Hope that's ok.


QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
